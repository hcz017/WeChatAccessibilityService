# AccessibilityService
ccessibility services are a feature of the Android framework designed to provide alternative navigation feedback to the user on behalf of
applications installed on Android devices. An accessibility service can communicate to the user on the application's behalf, such as 
converting text to speech, or haptic feedback when a user is hovering on an important area of the screen.
